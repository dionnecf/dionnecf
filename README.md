# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I'm Dionne, welcome to my profile!

I'm a Tech Career Coach and Speaker with 20 years experience as a Software Developer, and 18 experience as an Agile Development Lead (aka Engineering Manager).

I help women who are frsutrated in their current jobs, build inner confidence to make a career change into tech, through a soulful exploration of mindset, skillsets and next steps.  We'll focus on getting clarity on your goals, identifing limited beliefs that are holding you back, creating a realistic action plan within a realistic timeframe, and most importantly keeping you accountable.
